  <LongDescription>## Description
This is a mod that provides several collections of icons matching the game's UI style for modders to use in their mods.   This means that modders don't have to waste time finding or re-creating icons, or manually loading them into the game's UI.

This doesn't do anything unless you have a mod that uses it, in which case it's required.


### Modders

All icons are automatically pre-injected into the game's UI and are accessible via coui://uil/StyleName/IconName.  For more details, see the GitHub page.

The initial styles are Standard, Dark, and Colored.  More will be added later.  Requests for new styles are welcome!)</LongDescription>
